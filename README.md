This is Fork of the [Audio Switcher Plugin](https://github.com/StreamController/AudioSwitcher) for the App [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController).

It pretty much does the same, as the orinigal plugin, but with the input sources. So it enables the user to switch between multiple input sources with one button.
