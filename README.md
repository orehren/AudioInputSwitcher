# Audio Switcher Plugin (Fork)

This is a fork of the [Audio Switcher Plugin](https://github.com/StreamController/AudioSwitcher) for the app [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController).

This fork provides the same functionality as the original plugin, allowing users to easily switch between audio sources with a single button. However, this plugin allows users to switch the input sources instead of the output sources. Input sources can be:

* External microphones
* Internal webcam microphones

# Reason for Fork:

The original Audio Switcher plugin focuses on audio output sources. However, in my workflow, I needed to quickly switch between different input sources. Specifically, I wanted to alternate between using my external microphone (Logitech Blue Yeti X) for high-quality recordings and the built-in microphone on my Logitech Brio Webcam Ultra HD for quick video calls. This fork modifies the plugin to provide that input switching functionality.

# Maintenance:

This repository serves as a learning exercise for my students, demonstrating code modification and the process of uploading a plugin to GitHub. As such, this is not an actively maintained plugin, and I am not affiliated with the original plugin or the StreamController project.
