This is Fork of the [Audio Switcher Plugin](https://github.com/StreamController/AudioSwitcher) for the App [StreamController](https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController).

It pretty much does the same, as the orinigal plugin, but with the input sources. So it enables the user to switch between multiple input sources (e.g. external microphone and the internal microphone of the webcam) with one button.
